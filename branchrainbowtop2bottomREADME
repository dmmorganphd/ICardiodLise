Project to adapt the cardiod I prepared for Lise that one Valentine's day
to produce a variety of output images with different colorings. 

Substantial development work not done using git is recorded in ./early;
there are a variety of diagnostic and output images in ./early/images. 

On branch rainbowl2r: 

Creating output that produces a rainbow pattern from left to right acros
the cardiod. 

On branch rainbowtop2bottom:

Creating output that produces rainbow patterns from top to bottom and
vice versa. 

Added "Rainbow U2D.jpg" to images. 
Added "Rainbow D2U.jpg" to images. 
Added "LU2D UD2U.jpg" to images. 

Problem: commited on branch but didn't merge.
